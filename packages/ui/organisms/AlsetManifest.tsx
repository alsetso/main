        We were raised here — where winters are unforgiving, but people aren't. Where the work is honest, the expectations are high, and your word still matters more than your marketing.

      <ContentBlock size="md" className="mt-6">
        Where growth comes from grit, not gimmicks. Where you don't ask for permission to build something great. You just do it.

        Minnesota isn't a place. It's a mindset. A quiet confidence that says: "If we're going to build it, we're going to build it right."

      <ContentBlock size="md" className="mt-8">
        That's why Alset exists. Not to strip businesses for parts. Not to flip them. Not to roll them into a portfolio you'll never hear about again.

        We don't run a fund. We run with owners.

        We form Joint Ventures with Minnesota companies — Acquisition JVs for owners ready to sell or step out, Equity JVs for owners ready to scale with a true partner, Transition JVs for owners who want their business to outlive them without losing what made it special.

      <ContentBlock size="md" className="mt-6">
        And for the owners who want to stay 100% in control, we built our In-House Growth Team — Lending to unlock capital, Scale to unleash growth — without giving up a single share.

      <ContentBlock size="md" className="mt-6">
        Because in Minnesota, ownership still matters. Legacy still matters. The people behind the business still matter.

        We are operators, not spectators. Builders, not brokers. Partners, not passengers. We invest with our hands, our heads, and our whole reputation. We modernize without erasing. We grow without breaking. We make strong companies stronger — from the inside out.

      <ContentBlock size="md" className="mt-8">
        Our mission is simple: Help good people build great companies through partnership, capital, and execution that lasts.

      <ContentBlock size="md" className="mt-6">
        Because when Minnesota builds, it builds things that stand through storms — and stand for generations.
